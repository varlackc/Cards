This program is design to simulate the behaviour of a deck of cards.

The cards that will be used for the program will correspond to the standard 52-card deck.

The cards will have four suits: clubs (♣), diamonds (♦), hearts (♥) and spades (♠).
There are also three types of court cards wich are the King, Queen and Jack.

In order to test the functionality of the card appliation you can run the tests by using the following command:

`python -m unittest`
