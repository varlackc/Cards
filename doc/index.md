# Documentation for the Cards program

This are the instructions on how to use the card program.

Each card contains both `rank` and `suite`.
Eeach card is represented as a `tuple` of both `suite` and `rank`.

Additional elements that are part of the car program include `card decks` and `card hands`.

## How to call the Cards project files

The first step is to import the files in the `card` folder and select the classes that contain the components that you are trying to use. The following example shows how to call the `card` class:

```python
from card import Card
```

There is also the possibility of importing all of the classes in the project using the following call:

```python
from card import *
```
